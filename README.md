FastGrep
========

This project aims to provide a free clone for some of the functionality of the 
famous BareGrep utility and act as a playground for async programming models 
and parallelism.

I want to make it faster than BareGrep (multicore, parallel searching) and more
user friendly (keyboard shortcuts) and give it a better UI.

It is preferable to compile from a hg working copy to get changeset ids
embedded into the version number.

This is a playground/hobby project. Maybe it will grow into a nice utility someday.

Note: MSBuild Community Tasks is no longer required to compile the project as of rev 1dc0d1e065ad.
