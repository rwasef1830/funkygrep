FastGrep
========

This project aims to provide a free clone for some of the functionality of the 
famous BareGrep utility and act as a playground for async programming models 
and parallelism.

I want to make it faster than BareGrep (multicore, parallel searching) and more
user friendly (keyboard shortcuts) and give it a better UI.

In order to compile this project at minimum, you must have
MSBuild Community Tasks (http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/) installed 
on your machine.

It is preferable to compile from a hg working copy to get changeset ids
embedded into the version number.

This is a playground/hobby project. Maybe it will grow into a nice utility someday.
